A recent update to [Facebook Messenger](http://www.messenger.com) has broken the way code blocks are displayed. The messages are word wrapped for seemingly no reason.

A tiny CSS tweak can fix the problem and give you the code blocks you deserve.

## Demo

### Before:

### After:

## Installation

### 1. Get a CSS injection addon for your browser.

You can use Stylus for [Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/stylus/clngdbkpkpeebahjckkjfobafhncgmne?hl=en) or [Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/styl-us/).

Don't use Stylish, [it's spyware](https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/8vpqqg/stylish_browser_extension_steals_all_your/).

### 2. Copy the fixed CSS into the CSS injector.

The fixed CSS is in the `fix.css` file.
