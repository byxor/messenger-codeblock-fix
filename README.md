A recent update to [Facebook Messenger](http://www.messenger.com) has broken the way code blocks are displayed by giving them a very thin fixed width.

This CSS fixes the problem and gives you the code blocks you deserve.

## Demo

### Before:
![Image of codeblock before fix](before.png)

### After:
![Image of codeblock after fix](after.png)

## How to Install:

Use a CSS injection addon for your browser.

Copy the fixed CSS from `style.css` into the CSS injector.

I'm using [Stylish](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/stylish/) for Firefox.

It's also available for [Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/stylish-custom-themes-for/fjnbnpbmkenffdnngjfgmeleoegfcffe?hl=en).
